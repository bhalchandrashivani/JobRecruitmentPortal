1.	What problem are you trying to solve?
            
  I am trying to work out a different solution towards job recruitment during job fairs which involves the role of University Students and Employer. The application portal acts as a single place for both the students and employer to look out for open positions and applicants respectively. Roles and tasks are designed for both employers and students.

2.	Roles and Functionality in brief:

Functionalities performed by the application are as follows:

1.	Registration for both and Login for both based on 2 roles, the employer and university student over the portal
2.	The role of the employer performs the following tasks: 

  •	 Register as an employer on the portal
  •	Post job vacancies in detail on the portal
  •	Update or delete the existing jobs that has already been posted on the portal
  •	View all his jobs posted on the portal
  •	View a list of students who have applied for each job through this portal
  •	Email an applicant he remembers he has had a conversation with during the job fair via portal
3.	The role of the Student performs the following tasks:

  •	Register as a Student on the portal
  •	View all the jobs available on the portal in detail
  •	Apply for a job which includes uploading of resume and cover letter through the portal
  •	View all jobs applied by him via this portal
  •	Withdraw a job application from his list of applied jobs
  •	Receive an email by the employer via portal

 Technologies used:
  •	The project ensures use of Spring and hibernate and code in JAVA. 
  •	Duplicate user login is avoided.
  •	The project ensures Hashing for passwords before storage to manage security
  •	The Project ensures Spring Security using Filters to avoid page caching etc.
  •	The project applies SMTP protocol by incorporation the email communication
